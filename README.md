# UE5MMExample
A ready to go Unreal Engine 5 Mod Manager Example Project.
(UE version 5.3.1)

This is intended as a long-term project and I will expand the functionality as my free time allows. 
And hopefully this will spare other developers the headaches surrounding unreal and modding. 
And hundreds of hours of research too. 

I expect to upload version 1 of the project by the end of this year.
