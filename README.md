# UE5MMExample
A ready to use Unreal Engine 5 Mod Manager Example Project.
(UE version 5.3.2)

This is intended as a long-term project and I will expand the functionality as my free time allows. 
Hopefully this will spare other developers the headaches surrounding unreal and modding. 
And probably hundreds of hours of research too. 

I expect to upload a polished version 1 of the project by the end of this year.
